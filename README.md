# ðŸš¨ Warning! ðŸš¨
Heroku has decided to remove it's free tier subscription at the end of November 28, 2022.
How does this affect you? If use my mock api (thank you very much!), and it is hosted under Heroku's free tier service. This will remain on Heroku until the service it up while in the meantime, other hosting services are being researched into. Thank you very much for taking the time into reading this message and let me know if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.


## Description
This is my mock version of an API displaying classic cars. You can use this mock API by GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc requests to it. 

```
fetch('https://classic-car-api.herokuapp.com/Cars/0')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```
Feel free to add on to the API by making a pull request. It is hosted live on Heroku.com [here.](https://classic-car-api.herokuapp.com/)
